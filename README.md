This is the answer for the forum task (Infix to Postfix) for group 4.

Define what is the base case for the problem:
This problem does not exactly have a 'best case' due to it's time complexity being directly proportional to the length of
the expression so in this case the shortest expression can be considered as the best case . Example: 'a + b'

Define what is the base case for the problem:
There is no exact general case for this problem because it is dependant on the input of the user, like how there is no
general case for a calculator but we still provide a general expression. Example: 'a + b * c / (d - e)'



Results:
Time taken to execute iterative version of the code: 1.4008 milliseconds
Time taken to execute recursive version of the code: 1.2047 milliseconds
